Fixed Case and Imported 3D models into Fusion

First, I had to fix the case (again) because the hole for the xiao was not big enough, so I had to modify both the top and bottom until they matched up, next I imported 3d models for the xiao, mx switches, keycaps, the oled and the rotary encoder. This took me a minute because I am still an amateur to Fusion and I hate having to line everything up properly, but I eventually got it all to line up and came out with this. I also created the firmware for the entire device which is found in my repo on github.

Created bottom case / Fixed top case

First, I had to fix the top case because all of the dimensions were too small and I forgot too account for the edges that had to connect the top and the bottom. Then, I started the bottom case and made it pretty similar to the hackpad case because i liked the design of that one in particular. I then had to also account for the oled screen and rotary encoder that I had almost completely forgotten about. This took me a while to figure out for some reason.

Created the top case

I have created the top case for the deck. I know that the OLED may not look centered, and that is because it is not, that is just the place that I would like it to be in.

Routed PCB / Fixed Schematic

I had to fix a few things on the schematic that were not wired properly, then I put them on a pcb and attempted to route it. It went alright because I am certainty not a professional at this stuff yet. It may be messy, but it works so I'll take it! I will make the case for it in Fusion tomorrow.

Created Schematic / Added Footprints

I created the schematic with 8 switches, a rotary encoder and a oled screen. I tried using labels this time instead of just wiring this time. I used the xiao rp2040 which is the same as the hackpad! It took me a while because this is only my second project.I also added the correct footprints for everything on the schematic and set SW9 to not actually show up on the PCB as it does not need to according to my research, below is an image of the schematic
